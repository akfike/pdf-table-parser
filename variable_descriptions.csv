ATXMDEYR,"NOTE: The variables in this section are recoded variables that were created from one or more of the edited or imputed variables from the preceding sections. NOTE: Certain source variables that were used to create recoded variables have valid values that might not have been reported or assigned for the current survey year. However, these values have been included in the general specifications in the codebook on how the recoded variables were created. See additional details about this issue in the Organization of the Data File section of this codebook introduction. NOTE: The following 16 variables are among all adult respondents who were asked the respective questions and are not confined to those respondents who were ultimately classified as having a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in their lifetime or past year. To produce estimates among adults with MDE, the analysis will need to be restricted by either the lifetime MDE variable (IRAMDELT) or the past year MDE variable"

AGE3,"NOTE: After a respondent has entered his/her birthdate in the first part of the questionnaire, he/she has multiple opportunities to change his/her age in response to consistency checks throughout the questionnaire. It is therefore possible for the age recorded by the respondent at the beginning of the questionnaire to be different than the age at the end of the questionnaire. The final age variable is determined using these two constituent age variables, in addition to the age calculated from the raw birthdate and the final edited interview date, the age entered in the questionnaire roster (if it exists), and the pre-interview screener age."

BKDRUG,"In the past 12 months, were you arrested and booked for possession, manufacture, or sale of drugs?"
ADDPREV,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: All of the respondents aged 18 or older were asked the questions in the Adult Depression module in this current survey year.

AIIND102,"The Census provides data for five types of American Indian areas (AIAs): • Federally-recognized American Indian reservations (AIRs) and off-reservation trust land areas – areas that have been set aside by the U.S. for the use of American Indian tribes. The tribes have primary governmental authority over the AIRs and associated off-reservation trust lands. Federal AIRs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State-recognized American Indian Reservations (SAIRs) - reservations established by some State governments for tribes recognized by the State. The tribes may have governmental authority over the SAIRs. SAIRs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. • Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) - areas intended to represent the former American Indian reservations that existed in Indian and Oklahoma territories prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. OTSAs are contained within the State of Oklahoma but may cross all other area boundaries. • Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) - areas identified and delineated for federally-recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. A TDSA is intended to encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with the delineating federally-recognized American Indian tribe. TDSAs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs) - areas identified and delineated for State-recognized tribes that are not federally- recognized and do not have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. SDTSAs provide State-recognized tribes without reservations statistical data for a geographic area that encompasses a substantial concentration of tribal members. SDTSAs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. The AIAs are mutually exclusive, i.e., no AIA can overlap another AIA. In cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. The variable AIIND102 is based on 2010 census data and is defined by mapping the census block in which a respondent resides to the 2010 census file."

AKSSLR6WRST,"NOTE: The following variable, AKSSLR6WRST, is an alternative version of the original worst K6 total score in the past year (KSSLR6MAX) with values ranging from 0 to 17 rather than 0 to 24. This alternative total score was calculated by assigning a value of 0 when KSSLR6MAX had a value from 0 to 7 and assigning a value of 1 to 17 when KSSLR6MAX had a corresponding value from 8 to 24. This alternative version was used in the regression model to determine SMI because SMI prevalence was typically extremely low for respondents with worst K6 total scores less than 8. Specific details about this variable are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix."

However, these respondents subsequently specified a valid response for an offense in the past 12 months. A code of 5 in BKOTH indicates that respondents reported being arrested/booked at least once in the past 12 months but did not indicate at least one offense for which they were arrested in that period. In the past 12 months, were you arrested and booked for some other offense besides these that have been named? Please do not include minor traffic violations."

We are not asking about times when you only had a sip or two from a drink. Have you ever, even once, had a drink of any type of alcoholic beverage? Please do not include times when you only had a sip or two from a drink."

ALCNUMDKPM,"The following variable, ALCNUMDKPM, was defined as the product of the number of days a user consumed alcohol in the past month (IRALCFM) and the average number of drinks consumed per day on the days alcohol was used in the past month (ALCUS30D). A value of missing was assigned whenever a respondent said that they had not used alcohol in the past month (IRALCFM=91, 93 or ALCUS30D=991, 993) or the average number of drinks consumed per day on the days alcohol was used in the past month was unknown (ALCUS30D=985, 994, 997, 998) or logically assigned to 5 or more (ALCUS30D=975)."

BLNTEVER,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: When respondents previously reported never using marijuana but reported lifetime use of cigars with marijuana in them (i.e., ""blunts""), a consistency check was triggered only when respondents reported using blunts in the past 30 days. Therefore, BLNTEVER was assigned a code of 11 when respondents reported using blunts but they did not report use in the past 30 days, and they previously had reported never using marijuana. Sometimes people take some tobacco out of a cigar and replace it with marijuana. This is sometimes called a ""blunt"". Have you ever smoked part or all of a cigar with marijuana in it?"

ADPSDAYS,"NOTE: Beginning with the 2008 survey, respondents who answered ""don't know"" or ""refused"" to questions corresponding to the variables ADPSHMGT, ADPSWORK, ADPSRELS, and ADPSSOC are no longer asked the question corresponding to ADPSDAYS unless they entered a response of 1 to 10 in at least one of the other questions corresponding to ADPSHMGT through ADPSSOC. About how many days out of 365 in the past 12 months were you totally unable to work or carry out your normal activities because of your You can use any number between 0 and 365 to answer"
ALCUS30D,"NOTE: Beginning in 2015, level 975 was updated to ""AT LEAST 4 or 5 Logically assigned"" to reflect the change in the threshold for binge alcohol use among female respondents from 5 or more drinks on an occasion prior to 2015 to 4 or more drinks on an occasion in 2015. See the note below for ALCBNG30D. On the ALC30DAY/ALCESTFL days that you drank during the past 30 days, how many drinks did you usually have? Count as a drink a can or bottle of beer; a wine cooler or a glass of wine, champagne, or sherry; a shot of liquor or a mixed drink or cocktail."
BLNTNOMJ,"NOTE: The variable BLNTNOMJ was assigned a code of 5 if respondents were not asked this question because they reported in the TOBACCO module that they smoked cigars in the past 30 days but reported in the BLUNTS module that they did not smoke cigars with marijuana in them in the past 30 days. It could be logically inferred that all of the cigars that these respondents smoked in the past 30 days did not have marijuana in them. BLNTNOMJ was assigned codes of 14 or 24 if respondents were not asked this question and they reported in the BLUNTS module that they smoked a cigar with marijuana in it in the past 30 days. A code of 14 was assigned if respondents reported in the TOBACCO module that they had smoked cigars but not in the past 30 days. A code of 24 was assigned if respondents reported in the TOBACCO module that they had never smoked part or all of a cigar. Earlier, you reported that you had smoked part or all of a cigar during the past 30 days. During the past 30 days, did you smoke any cigars that did not have marijuana in them?"
ADPSHMGT,"NOTE: Beginning with the 2008 survey, the questions corresponding to the variables ADPSHMGT, ADPSWORK, ADPSRELS, and ADPSSOC no longer allow respondents to choose the category 95 (ACTIVITY DOES NOT APPLY). Think about the time in the past 12 months when [NUMPROBS] with your mood [WASWERE] most severe. Using the 0 to 10 scale shown below, where 0 means no interference and 10 means very severe interference, select the number that describes how much [NUMPROBS] interfered with your ability to do each of the following activities during that period. You can use any number between 0 and 10 to answer. How much did your [FEELNOUN] interfere with your ability to do home management task, like cleaning, shopping, and working around the house, apartment, or yard?"
ALCYDAYS,
BLNTREC,"NOTE: When respondents previously reported using marijuana but reported less recent use of marijuana than they reported for blunts, a consistency check was triggered only when respondents reported using blunts in the past 30 days. Therefore, BLNTREC was assigned a code of 12 when respondents reported last using marijuana more than 12 months ago but reported using blunts more than 30 days ago but within the past 12 months. How long has it been since you last smoked part or all of a cigar with marijuana in it?"

ADPSWORK,"During that time in the past 12 months when your [FEELNOUN] was most severe, how much did this interfere with your ability to work? You can use any number between 0 and 10 to answer."
ALCYR,
BMI2,"BMI2 was created from the variables WTPOUND2 and HTINCHE2 according to the formula of 703 times WTPOUND2 divided by the square of HTINCHE2. BMI2 was set to a SAS missing value (unknown) if WTPOUND2 had a value of 9985, 9994, 9997, or 9998 or if HTINCHE2 had a value of 985, 994, 997, or 998."
ADPSYCH,
ALCYRBFR,"NOTE: The variables ALCYRBFR and ALCAGLST were not edited with respect to one another. Therefore, inconsistencies could exist between these two variables. Earlier questions were about the past 12 months.

BOOKED,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. The next questions are about encounters with the police or the court system. Not counting minor traffic violations, have you ever been arrested and booked for breaking the law? Being ""booked"" means that you were taken into custody and processed by the police or by someone connected with the courts, even if you were then released."

Adults with a past year MDE (AMDEYR=1) and a ""severe"" or ""very severe"" maximum level of interference are assigned AMDEIMP=1. Adults without a past year MDE (AMDEYR=2) or a maximum level of interference of ""none"", ""mild"", or ""moderate"" (and no missing data across the four role domains) are assigned AMDEIMP=2. All other respondents are assigned a missing value for AMDEIMP. Beginning in 2021, missing values for AMDEIMP were replaced using statistical imputation. The imputation-revised variable used in analysis, IRAMDEIMP, appears in the Imputed Adult Depression section."

A respondent was classified as having a major depressive episode (MDE) in their lifetime, AMDELT=1, if they reported experiencing at least five out of the nine criteria used to define an adult as having had MDE in their lifetime, where at least one of the criteria is a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities (ADSMMDEA=1). An adult was classified as NOT having a major depressive episode (MDE) in their lifetime, AMDELT=2, if they met either of these conditions: 1. Reported experiencing fewer than five out of the nine criteria used to define an adult as having had MDE in their lifetime 2. If the number of criteria used to define an adult as having had MDE in their lifetime is unknown (ADSMMDEA=94,97,98) and the respondent reported at least one of the following: 1.

This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: Beginning in 2017, respondents who reported that they used alcohol on 0 days in the past 30 days are no longer asked questions in the consumption of alcohol module that pertain to the past 30 days.

However, this change was determined not to have affected the comparability of estimates since 2017 with those prior to 2017. Next we return to the topic of alcohol. Remember that by a ""drink"", we mean a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it. We are not asking about times when you only had a sip or two from a drink.

The severity of an SUD according to DSM-5 criteria is determined by the number of individual criteria recorded as positive for a particular substance. Respondents were classified as having an SUD of mild severity if they met two or three SUD criteria for that substance, an SUD of moderate severity if they met four or five SUD criteria for that substance, and a severe SUD if they met six or more SUD criteria for that substance. The construction of all SUD variables is described in more detail in the Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Disorder appendix. NOTE: Respondents who reported past year alcohol use but indicated use of alcohol on 5 or fewer days in the past year were not asked the questions on alcohol use disorder. However, respondents who reported past year alcohol use and had a missing value for the number of days they used alcohol in the past year were asked the questions on alcohol use disorder.

MAIIN102,"The Census provides data for five types of American Indian areas (AIAs): • Federally-recognized American Indian reservations (AIRs) and off-reservation trust land areas – areas that have been set aside by the U.S. for the use of American Indian tribes. The tribes have primary governmental authority over the AIRs and associated off-reservation trust lands. Federal AIRs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State-recognized American Indian Reservations (SAIRs) - reservations established by some State governments for tribes recognized by the State. The tribes may have governmental authority over the SAIRs. SAIRs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. • Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) - areas intended to represent the former American Indian reservations that existed in Indian and Oklahoma territories prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. OTSAs are contained within the State of Oklahoma but may cross all other area boundaries. • Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) - areas identified and delineated for federally-recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. A TDSA is intended to encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with the delineating federally-recognized American Indian tribe. TDSAs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs) - areas identified and delineated for State-recognized tribes that are not federally- recognized and do not have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. SDTSAs provide State-recognized tribes without reservations statistical data for a geographic area that encompasses a substantial concentration of tribal members. SDTSAs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. The AIAs are mutually exclusive, i.e., no AIA can overlap another AIA. In cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. Some NSDUH segments can cross more than one AIA. In order to assign a single AIA to a segment, a ‘majority’ AIA variable was created by summing the total number of dwelling units within each of the AIAs within the segment and then assigning the AIA with the most dwelling units to that segment. The resulting 'majority' AIAs were summarized to form MAIIN102. MAIIN102 is based on 2010 census data."

NDSSDEPND,"NOTE: The following dependence variables were defined based on the dependence criteria according to the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) and the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) for respondents who smoked cigarettes in the past month (i.e., CIGMON=1). The NDSS criteria for dependence was based on 17 questions pertaining to five aspects of dependence. Based on the NDSS, a respondent was defined as having nicotine dependence, NDSSDEPND=1, if the sum of the valid responses (based on actual reporting) was greater than or equal to 46.75. The FTND measure is defined by assessing how soon after waking a respondent had their first cigarette (CIGWAKE). Based on the FTND scale, a respondent was defined as having nicotine dependence, FTNDDEPND=1, if the first cigarette was smoked within 30 minutes of waking up on the days they smoked (CIGWAKE=1 or 2) and the respondent smoked cigarettes in the past month (CIGMON=1). Based on the NDSS and the FTND, a respondent who smoked cigarettes in the past month was defined as having nicotine dependence, PMNICDEP=1, if they met either the NDSS or the FTND criteria for dependence. Specific details are provided in the Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Disorder appendix.

PNRMAINRSN,"The following main reason for misusing pain relievers, PNRMAINRSN, is defined based on answers to questions about respondents’ reasons for misusing pain relievers for their last misuse. Respondents could report more than one reason for misusing pain relievers the last time. If they reported more than one reason, then they were asked to report the main reason. If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data. In the documentation below, values of 11-18 in PNRRSMAIN reflect situations where respondents reported more than one reason for their last misuse, their “other” reason for their last misuse was their main reason for their last misuse, but the other reason was the reason specified as one of the eight categories below. 1. Main reason is to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=1,11), reported only one reason which was to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSPAIN=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSPAIN=3). 2. Main reason is to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=2,12), reported only one reason which was to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSRELX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSRELX=3). 3. Main reason is to experiment or see what it’s like (PNRRSMAIN=3,13), reported only one reason which was to experiment or see what it’s like (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEXPT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to experiment or see what it's like (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEXPT=3). 4. Main reason is to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=4,14), reported only one reason which was to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRHIGH=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHIGH=3). 5. Main reason is to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=5,15), reported only one reason which was to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSLEP=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSLEP=3). 6. Main reason is to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=6,16), reported only one reason which was to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEMOT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEMOT=3). 7. Main reason is to increase/decrease effects of other drugs (PNRRSMAIN=7,17), reported only one reason which was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSDGFX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSDGFX=3). 8. Main reason is because hooked or have to have drug (PNRRSMAIN=8,18), reported only one reason which was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHOOK=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHOOK=3). 9. Main reason is some other reason (PNRRSMAIN=9), or reported only one reason which was a valid other reason listed for pain relievers other than those defined above based on the write in data (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSOR=1 and PNRRSOTRS2=9-71). Values of 1-8 that are in the specific other reason level are write in responses that do not correspond to reasons listed for pain relievers but are considered valid reasons so are not excluded. (System Missing): Main reason is unknown (PNRRSMAIN=85,94,98) or reported only one reason and the other pain reliever reason was not a valid reason (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSOR=1 and PNRRSOTRS2=985,994,997).

SEDNMYFU,
POVERTY3,"The following variable, POVERTY3, indicates a person’s family income relative to poverty thresholds. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a poverty threshold for each combination of family size and number of children in the household. To be at 100% of the poverty threshold is equivalent to having a family income that is the same as the poverty threshold. A poverty level less than 100% indicates having a family income less than the poverty threshold and therefore defined by the Federal government as living in poverty. A poverty level greater than 100% indicates having a family income greater than the poverty threshold. The previously created variable POVERTY2, was created using the recoded version of family income that had a top-coded level of $100,000 or more. Starting in 2015, the finer income questions were revised to expand the top level to include the responses $100,000 - $149,999 and $150,000 or more. The variable POVERTY3 account for these additional income levels through the use of the finer family income variable. Despite these changes, POVERTY3 is considered comparable with POVERTY2. POVERTY3 was created for each individual based on their poverty threshold (determined by their age, family size, the number of children in the household, and total family income). Since NSDUH only collects categorical values of family income, for each level of income, the midpoint of each range was assigned as the effective family income. The highest level of income, $150,000 or more, was assigned a value of $180,000. Prior to the questionnaire change in 2015 that expanded the top level of income categories, the highest level of income was $100,000 or more and the assigned family income was $120,000. Family income was divided by the poverty threshold and multiplied by 100 to show family income as a percentage of the federal poverty threshold. Respondents aged 18 to 22 currently living in a college dormitory (GQTYPE2='C') were set to system missing and do not have a valid value for this variable."

SRCFRPNRNM,"NOTE: A respondent who misused prescription drugs in the past year was administered a question regarding the source of the drug during their most recent use. If they indicated that their most recent source was a 'friend or relative for free' from either of these questions, then a respondent was administered a follow-up question that asked the source the friend/relative had obtained the drug from. The following four variables pertain to the source from which a respondent's friend or relative obtained the drug for prescription pain relievers (SRCFRPNRNM), prescription tranquilizers (SRCFRTRQNM), prescription stimulants (SRCFRSTMNM), and prescription sedatives (SRCFRSEDNM) within the past year. For each of the following four variables, there are eight mutually exclusive categories for specific sources that the friend/relative obtained the drug from and a missing category for respondents who did not indicate using the drug in the past year (or lifetime) or a respondent that indicated in one of the previous questions that they had obtained the drug for most recent use from a valid source other than a friend or relative for free and respondents with unknown or invalid values. Based on the following conditions, a respondent was classified in one of the following nine categories (including System Missing) for the source of most recent prescription drug use in the past year for the variables, SRCFRPNRNM, SRCFRTRQNM, SRCFRSTMNM, and SRCFRSEDNM: 1. Got Prescription(s) from One Doctor (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=1, 11) 2. Got Prescription(s) from More Than One Doctor (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=2, 12) 3.

SUTOUTALCPY,"NOTE: This section includes recodes for the receipt of treatment as an outpatient for the following substances: alcohol (ALC), marijuana (MRJ), cocaine (COC), heroin (HER), hallucinogens (HAL), inhalants (INH), methamphetamine (MTH), pain relievers (PNR), stimulants (STM), tranquilizers (TRQ), sedatives (SED), tranquilizers or sedatives (TQSD), psychotherapeutics (PSY), opioids (OPI), central nervous system stimulants (CNS), drugs (DRG), alcohol and drugs (DRAL), and substance unspecified (UNSP). Because respondents can specify more than one drug for which they received treatment, there is a different variable for every drug (SUTOUTXXXPY). XXX in the variable name refers to the drug abbreviations in parentheses provided above. Because there is a relatively large number of respondents that did not indicate a substance for which they received outpatient treatment (respondents either answered no to or had missing data for all the substances they were asked about), it is important to consider the substance unspecified numbers (SUTOUTUNSPPY) when analyzing any of the specific substances or aggregate substance categories."

For each variable there are eight mutually exclusive categories for specific sources, and a missing category for respondents with no past year misuse or unknown responses to the source questions. The categories for the specific sources take into account responses from a single question asking about a single, most recent source of misuse among respondents who misused in the past year. Based on the following conditions, a respondent was classified in one of the following nine categories (including System Missing) for the source of most recent prescription drug misuse in the past year for the variables, SRCPNRNM2, SRCTRQNM2, SRCSTMNM2, and SRCSEDNM2: 1. Got From One Doctor 2. Got From More Than One Doctor 3. Stole from Dr Office, Clinic, Hospital, or Pharmacy 4. Got From Friend or Relative for Free 5. Bought from Friend or Relative 6.

STMMAINRSN,"The following main reason for misusing stimulants, STMMAINRSN, is defined based on answers to questions about respondents’ reasons for misusing stimulants for their last misuse. Respondents could report more than one reason for misusing stimulants the last time. If they reported more than one reason, then they were asked to report the main reason. If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data. In the documentation below, values of 11-18 in STMRSMAIN reflect situations where respondents reported more than one reason for their last misuse, their “other” reason for their last misuse was their main reason for their last misuse, but the other reason was the reason specified as one of the eight categories below. 1. Main reason is to help lose weight (STMRSMAIN=1,11), reported only one reason which was to help lose weight (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSWGHT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help lose weight (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSWGHT=3). 2. Main reason is to help concentrate (STMRSMAIN=2,12), reported only one reason which was to help concentrate (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSCONC=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help concentrate (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSCONC=3). 3. Main reason is to help be alert or stay awake (STMRSMAIN=3,13), reported only one reason which was to help be alert or stay awake (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSALRT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help be alert or stay awake (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSALRT=3). 4. Main reason is to help study (STMRSMAIN=4,14), reported only one reason which was to help study (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSTDY=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help study (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSTDY=3). 5. Main reason is to experiment or see what it’s like (STMRSMAIN=5,15), reported only one reason which was to experiment or see what it’s like (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSEXPT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to experiment or see what it's like (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSEXPT=3). 6. Main reason is to feel good or get high (STMRSMAIN=6,16), reported only one reason which was to feel good or get high (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHIGH=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to feel good or get high (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHIGH=3). 7. Main reason is to increase/decrease effects of other drugs (STMRSMAIN=7,17), reported only one reason which was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSDGFX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSDGFX=3). 8. Main reason is because hooked or have to have the drug (STMRSMAIN=8,18), reported only one reason which was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHOOK=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHOOK=3). 9. Main reason is some other reason (STMRSMAIN=9), or reported only one reason which was a valid other reason listed for stimulant other than those defined above based on the write in data (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSOR=1 and STMRSOTRS2=1,2,6,14- 35). Values of 3,4, and 7-12 that are in the specific other reason level are write in responses that do not correspond to reasons listed for stimulants but are considered valid reasons so are not excluded.

WHODASSCED,"NOTE: The following two variables, WHODASSCED and WHODASDAED, are score variables that indicate the level of impairment for respondents. These variables are based on data collected from a series of thirteen questions asking respondents how much difficulty they experienced in doing eight daily activities in the one month in the past year when they were at their worst emotionally. These questions, drawn from the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), comprise an abbreviated scale which is used to capture information on impairment (see the Recoded Mental Health Appendix for more information). Respondents who had indicated during the administration of any of the K6 items that they had experienced at least one of the K6 symptoms (defined in the note above variables KSSLR6MONED and KSSLR6YRED) at least ""a little of the time"" (i.e., KSSLR6MONED greater than 0 or KSSLR6YRED greater than 0) were asked about remembering to do things they needed to do (IMPREMEM), concentrating on doing something important when other things were going on around them (IMPCONCN), going out of the house and getting around on their own (IMPGOUT, IMPGOUTM), dealing with people they did not know well (IMPPEOP, IMPPEOPM), participating in social activities (IMPSOC, IMPSOCM), taking care of household responsibilities (IMPHHLD, IMPHHLDM), taking care of daily responsibilities at work or school (IMPRESP, IMPRESPM), and getting daily work done as quickly as needed (IMPWORK, IMPRESPM). Respondents who reported that they did not engage in an activity were asked a follow-up question to determine if they did not do so because of emotions, nerves, or mental health. For the WHODAS total score, WHODASSCED, a value of 3 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. A value of 2 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" difficulty performing, and a value of 1 was assigned for ""mild"" difficulty. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of 3 as having ""severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other non-missing responses for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASSCED which ranges from 0 to 24. WHODASSCED was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. For the alternative WHODAS total score, WHODASDAED, a value of 1 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" or ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of a 1 as having ""moderate or severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other non-missing responses for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASDAED which ranges from 0 to 8. WHODASDAED was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. Specific details about these variables are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix.

WHODASTOTSC,"NOTE: The following two variables, WHODASTOTSC and WHODASDASC, are score variables that indicate the level of impairment for respondents. These variables are based on imputation-revised data collected from a series of thirteen questions asking respondents how much difficulty they experienced in doing eight daily activities in the one month in the past year when they were at their worst emotionally (defined in the note above variables WHODASSCED and WHODASDAED). For the original WHODAS total score, WHODASTOTSC, a value of 3 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. A value of 2 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" difficulty performing, and a value of 1 was assigned for ""mild"" difficulty. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of 3 as having ""severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other responses (or imputed values) for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASTOTSC which ranges from 0 to 24. WHODASTOTSC was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. For the alternative WHODAS total score, WHODASDASC, a value of 1 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" or ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of a 1 as having ""moderate or severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other responses (or imputed values) for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASDASC which ranges from 0 to 8. WHODASDASC was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. The alternative version of the WHODAS total score (WHODASDASC) was used in the regression model to determine SMI. Specific details about these variables are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix. (IRIMPCONCN, IRIMPGOUT, IRIMPGOUTM, IRIMPHHLD, IRIMPHHLDM, IRIMPPEOP, IRIMPPEOPM, IRIMPREMEM, IRIMPRESP, IRIMPRESPM, IRIMPSOC, IRIMPSOCM, IRIMPWORK, KSSLR6MAX)"

However, these values have been included in the general specifications in the codebook on how the recoded variables were created. See additional details about this issue in the Organization of the Data File section of this codebook introduction. NOTE: Respondents were administered separate age-appropriate depression modules designed to measure whether or not respondents had experienced a major depressive episode (MDE) in their lifetime and past year. All adolescent (youth) respondents aged 12 to 17 were asked questions from the Adolescent Depression section. All adults aged 18 or older were administered the questions in the Adult Depression section.
