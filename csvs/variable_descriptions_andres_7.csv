PNRANYFLAG,"NOTE: The following 16 variables refer to any use of prescription drugs. Any Use of prescription drugs is defined as either the use of one's own prescription medication as directed by a doctor or the misuse of prescription drugs. Misuse of prescription drugs is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own medication; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Due to potential underreporting of lifetime prescription drug use, users are cautioned against using the lifetime use or misuse of prescription pain relievers (ever used/ever misused) in analysis."

PNRMAINRSN,"The following main reason for misusing pain relievers, PNRMAINRSN, is defined based on answers to questions about respondents’ reasons for misusing pain relievers for their last misuse. Respondents could report more than one reason for misusing pain relievers the last time. If they reported more than one reason, then they were asked to report the main reason. If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data. In the documentation below, values of 11-18 in PNRRSMAIN reflect situations where respondents reported more than one reason for their last misuse, their “other” reason for their last misuse was their main reason for their last misuse, but the other reason was the reason specified as one of the eight categories below. 1. Main reason is to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=1,11), reported only one reason which was to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSPAIN=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSPAIN=3). 2. Main reason is to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=2,12), reported only one reason which was to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSRELX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSRELX=3). 3. Main reason is to experiment or see what it’s like (PNRRSMAIN=3,13), reported only one reason which was to experiment or see what it’s like (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEXPT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to experiment or see what it's like (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEXPT=3). 4. Main reason is to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=4,14), reported only one reason which was to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRHIGH=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHIGH=3). 5. Main reason is to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=5,15), reported only one reason which was to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSLEP=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSLEP=3). 6. Main reason is to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=6,16), reported only one reason which was to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEMOT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEMOT=3). 7. Main reason is to increase/decrease effects of other drugs (PNRRSMAIN=7,17), reported only one reason which was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSDGFX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSDGFX=3). 8. Main reason is because hooked or have to have drug (PNRRSMAIN=8,18), reported only one reason which was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHOOK=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHOOK=3). 9. Main reason is some other reason (PNRRSMAIN=9), or reported only one reason which was a valid other reason listed for pain relievers other than those defined above based on the write in data (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSOR=1 and PNRRSOTRS2=9-71). Values of 1-8 that are in the specific other reason level are write in responses that do not correspond to reasons listed for pain relievers but are considered valid reasons so are not excluded. (System Missing): Main reason is unknown (PNRRSMAIN=85,94,98) or reported only one reason and the other pain reliever reason was not a valid reason (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSOR=1 and PNRRSOTRS2=985,994,997).

Misuse of prescription drugs is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own medication; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Due to potential underreporting of lifetime prescription drug use, users are cautioned against using the lifetime misuse of prescription pain relievers (ever misused) in analysis."
RLGIMPT,
RXZOLPMIS,"NOTE: The following nine variables pertain to prescription sedative subtype misuse. These variables were revised starting with the 2021 NSDUH so that respondents with unknown past year misuse of the specific sedative subtype were coded as a system missing.

PNRNMINIT,"NOTE: PNRNMINIT is ""reverse coded"" from the answers in PRL03. PRL03=1 (yes) was recoded to 2 in PNRNMINIT because this answer means that the respondent misused pain relievers before the past 12 months (and therefore is not a past year initiate for misuse of pain relievers). PRL03=2 (no) was recoded to 1 in PNRNMINIT because this answer means that the respondent did not misuse pain relievers before the past 12 months (and therefore is a past year initiate for misuse of pain relievers). Earlier questions were about the past 12 months. This question is about any time before then, that is, any time in your life before [DATEFILL]. At any time before [DATEFILL], did you ever use any prescription pain reliever in a way a doctor did not direct you to use it?"

RSKCIGPKD,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: The variables in this section are considered to be comparable between 2015 and later years but are not comparable with variables in the 2014 NSDUH or prior years. We are interested in your opinion about the effects of using certain drugs and other substances, about whether it's difficult or easy to get drugs, and the extent to which drugs are available in your neighborhood. Please indicate how much you think people risk harming themselves physically and in other ways when they do each of the following activities. If you're not sure, choose an answer for the amount of risk that comes closest to what you think might be true for that activity.

POVERTY3,"The following variable, POVERTY3, indicates a person’s family income relative to poverty thresholds. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a poverty threshold for each combination of family size and number of children in the household. To be at 100% of the poverty threshold is equivalent to having a family income that is the same as the poverty threshold. A poverty level less than 100% indicates having a family income less than the poverty threshold and therefore defined by the Federal government as living in poverty. A poverty level greater than 100% indicates having a family income greater than the poverty threshold. The previously created variable POVERTY2, was created using the recoded version of family income that had a top-coded level of $100,000 or more. Starting in 2015, the finer income questions were revised to expand the top level to include the responses $100,000 - $149,999 and $150,000 or more. The variable POVERTY3 account for these additional income levels through the use of the finer family income variable. Despite these changes, POVERTY3 is considered comparable with POVERTY2. POVERTY3 was created for each individual based on their poverty threshold (determined by their age, family size, the number of children in the household, and total family income). Since NSDUH only collects categorical values of family income, for each level of income, the midpoint of each range was assigned as the effective family income. The highest level of income, $150,000 or more, was assigned a value of $180,000. Prior to the questionnaire change in 2015 that expanded the top level of income categories, the highest level of income was $100,000 or more and the assigned family income was $120,000. Family income was divided by the poverty threshold and multiplied by 100 to show family income as a percentage of the federal poverty threshold. Respondents aged 18 to 22 currently living in a college dormitory (GQTYPE2='C') were set to system missing and do not have a valid value for this variable."

PYUD5ALC,"The next set of variables are substance use disorder measures for alcohol and drugs and are based on the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Drugs include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and the use of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs (i.e., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives). These variables include missing values, while the imputation-revised versions of these variables in which missing values are replaced with valid response categories are described in the ""Imputed Substance Use Disorder"" section.The construction of all SUD variables is described in more detail in the Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Disorder appendix. NOTE: Respondents who reported past year alcohol use but indicated use of alcohol on 5 or fewer days in the past year were not asked the questions on alcohol use disorder.
