The NDSS criteria for dependence was based on 17 questions pertaining to five aspects of dependence. Based on the NDSS, a respondent was defined as having nicotine dependence, NDSSDEPND=1, if the sum of the valid responses (based on actual reporting) was greater than or equal to 46.75. The FTND measure is defined by assessing how soon after waking a respondent had their first cigarette (CIGWAKE). Based on the FTND scale, a respondent was defined as having nicotine dependence, FTNDDEPND=1, if the first cigarette was smoked within 30 minutes of waking up on the days they smoked (CIGWAKE=1 or 2) and the respondent smoked cigarettes in the past month (CIGMON=1). Based on the NDSS and the FTND, a respondent who smoked cigarettes in the past month was defined as having nicotine dependence, PMNICDEP=1, if they met either the NDSS or the FTND criteria for dependence. Specific details are provided in the Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Disorder appendix.
