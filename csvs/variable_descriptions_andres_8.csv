SRCFRPNRNM,"NOTE: A respondent who misused prescription drugs in the past year was administered a question regarding the source of the drug during their most recent use. If they indicated that their most recent source was a 'friend or relative for free' from either of these questions, then a respondent was administered a follow-up question that asked the source the friend/relative had obtained the drug from. The following four variables pertain to the source from which a respondent's friend or relative obtained the drug for prescription pain relievers (SRCFRPNRNM), prescription tranquilizers (SRCFRTRQNM), prescription stimulants (SRCFRSTMNM), and prescription sedatives (SRCFRSEDNM) within the past year. For each of the following four variables, there are eight mutually exclusive categories for specific sources that the friend/relative obtained the drug from and a missing category for respondents who did not indicate using the drug in the past year (or lifetime) or a respondent that indicated in one of the previous questions that they had obtained the drug for most recent use from a valid source other than a friend or relative for free and respondents with unknown or invalid values. Based on the following conditions, a respondent was classified in one of the following nine categories (including System Missing) for the source of most recent prescription drug use in the past year for the variables, SRCFRPNRNM, SRCFRTRQNM, SRCFRSTMNM, and SRCFRSEDNM: 1. Got Prescription(s) from One Doctor (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=1, 11) 2. Got Prescription(s) from More Than One Doctor (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=2, 12) 3. Stole from Dr Office, Clinic, Hospital, or Pharmacy(XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=3, 13) 4. Got From Friend or Relative for Free (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=4, 14) 5.

Bought from Drug Dealer or Other Stranger (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=7, 17) 8. Got Some Other Way (XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=8 and XXXFFGTSP=valid ""other"" response, levels 9-38, 71) (System Missing): No Past Year Misuse or Valid Source of Most Recent Misuse Not from Friend or Relative for Free /Unknown/Invalid Source (XXXGOTLAS not=4 or [XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=94, 97, 98)] or [XXXGOTLAS=4 and XXXFFGOT=8 and"
SUTOUTALCPY,"NOTE: This section includes recodes for the receipt of treatment as an outpatient for the following substances: alcohol (ALC), marijuana (MRJ), cocaine (COC), heroin (HER), hallucinogens (HAL), inhalants (INH), methamphetamine (MTH), pain relievers (PNR), stimulants (STM), tranquilizers (TRQ), sedatives (SED), tranquilizers or sedatives (TQSD), psychotherapeutics (PSY), opioids (OPI), central nervous system stimulants (CNS), drugs (DRG), alcohol and drugs (DRAL), and substance unspecified (UNSP). Because respondents can specify more than one drug for which they received treatment, there is a different variable for every drug (SUTOUTXXXPY). XXX in the variable name refers to the drug abbreviations in parentheses provided above. Because there is a relatively large number of respondents that did not indicate a substance for which they received outpatient treatment (respondents either answered no to or had missing data for all the substances they were asked about), it is important to consider the substance unspecified numbers (SUTOUTUNSPPY) when analyzing any of the specific substances or aggregate substance categories."

For each variable there are eight mutually exclusive categories for specific sources, and a missing category for respondents with no past year misuse or unknown responses to the source questions. The categories for the specific sources take into account responses from a single question asking about a single, most recent source of misuse among respondents who misused in the past year. Based on the following conditions, a respondent was classified in one of the following nine categories (including System Missing) for the source of most recent prescription drug misuse in the past year for the variables, SRCPNRNM2, SRCTRQNM2, SRCSTMNM2, and SRCSEDNM2: 1. Got From One Doctor 2. Got From More Than One Doctor 3. Stole from Dr Office, Clinic, Hospital, or Pharmacy 4. Got From Friend or Relative for Free 5. Bought from Friend or Relative 6.

STMMAINRSN,"The following main reason for misusing stimulants, STMMAINRSN, is defined based on answers to questions about respondents’ reasons for misusing stimulants for their last misuse. Respondents could report more than one reason for misusing stimulants the last time. If they reported more than one reason, then they were asked to report the main reason. If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data. In the documentation below, values of 11-18 in STMRSMAIN reflect situations where respondents reported more than one reason for their last misuse, their “other” reason for their last misuse was their main reason for their last misuse, but the other reason was the reason specified as one of the eight categories below. 1. Main reason is to help lose weight (STMRSMAIN=1,11), reported only one reason which was to help lose weight (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSWGHT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help lose weight (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSWGHT=3). 2. Main reason is to help concentrate (STMRSMAIN=2,12), reported only one reason which was to help concentrate (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSCONC=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help concentrate (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSCONC=3). 3. Main reason is to help be alert or stay awake (STMRSMAIN=3,13), reported only one reason which was to help be alert or stay awake (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSALRT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help be alert or stay awake (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSALRT=3). 4. Main reason is to help study (STMRSMAIN=4,14), reported only one reason which was to help study (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSTDY=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help study (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSTDY=3). 5. Main reason is to experiment or see what it’s like (STMRSMAIN=5,15), reported only one reason which was to experiment or see what it’s like (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSEXPT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to experiment or see what it's like (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSEXPT=3). 6. Main reason is to feel good or get high (STMRSMAIN=6,16), reported only one reason which was to feel good or get high (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHIGH=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to feel good or get high (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHIGH=3). 7. Main reason is to increase/decrease effects of other drugs (STMRSMAIN=7,17), reported only one reason which was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSDGFX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to increase/decrease the effects of other drugs (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSDGFX=3). 8. Main reason is because hooked or have to have the drug (STMRSMAIN=8,18), reported only one reason which was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHOOK=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was because they were hooked or had to have the drug (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSHOOK=3). 9. Main reason is some other reason (STMRSMAIN=9), or reported only one reason which was a valid other reason listed for stimulant other than those defined above based on the write in data (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSOR=1 and STMRSOTRS2=1,2,6,14- 35). Values of 3,4, and 7-12 that are in the specific other reason level are write in responses that do not correspond to reasons listed for stimulants but are considered valid reasons so are not excluded. (System Missing): Main reason is unknown (STMRSMAIN=85,94,98) or reported only one reason and the other reason was not a valid reason (STMRSMAIN=99 and STMRSSOR=1 and STMRSOTRS2 = 985,994,997).

STMNMINIT,"NOTE: STMNMINIT is ""reverse coded"" from the answers in STL03. STL03=1 (yes) was recoded to 2 in STMNMINIT because this answer means that the respondent misused stimulants before the past 12 months (and therefore is not a past year initiate for misuse of stimulants). STL03=2 (no) was recoded to 1 in STMNMINIT because this answer means that the respondent did not misuse stimulants before the past 12 months (and therefore is a past year initiate for misuse of stimulants). Earlier questions were about the past 12 months. This question is about any time before then, that is, any time in your life before [DATEFILL]. At any time before [DATEFILL], did you ever use any prescription stimulant in a way a doctor did not direct you to use it?"

TRQMAINRSN,"The following main reason for misusing tranquilizers, TRQMAINRSN, is defined based on answers to questions about respondents’ reasons for misusing tranquilizers for their last misuse. Respondents could report more than one reason for misusing tranquilizers the last time. If they reported more than one reason, then they were asked to report the main reason. If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data. In the documentation below, values of 11-17 in TRQRSMAIN reflect situations where respondents reported more than one reason for their last misuse, their “other” reason for their last misuse was their main reason for their last misuse, but the other reason was the reason specified as one of the seven categories below. 1. Main reason is to relax or relieve tension (TRQRSMAIN=1,11), reported only one reason which was to relax or relieve tension (TRQRSMAIN=99 and TRQRSRELX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relax or relieve tension (TRQRSMAIN=99 and TRQRSRELX=3). 2.

TRL03=2 (no) was recoded to 1 in TRQNMINIT because this answer means that the respondent did not misuse tranquilizers before the past 12 months (and therefore is a past year initiate for misuse of tranquilizers). Earlier questions were about the past 12 months. This question is about any time before then, that is, any time in your life before [DATEFILL].
