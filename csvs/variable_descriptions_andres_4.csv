IRALCBNG30D,"""Binge"" Alcohol Frequency, IRALCBNG30D, is defined as the number of days in the past month on which the respondent reported drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion for males or four or more drinks on the same occasion for females. For this variable, ""occasion"" means at the same time or within a couple hours of each other. Prior to 2015, “binge” alcohol frequency was defined as the number of days in the past month on which the respondent reported drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion for everyone, regardless of sex. Therefore, IRALCBNG30D is comparable to the version of this variable created from 2002-2014, IRALCD5, among males but not overall or among females."
