WHODASSCED,"NOTE: The following two variables, WHODASSCED and WHODASDAED, are score variables that indicate the level of impairment for respondents. These variables are based on data collected from a series of thirteen questions asking respondents how much difficulty they experienced in doing eight daily activities in the one month in the past year when they were at their worst emotionally. These questions, drawn from the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), comprise an abbreviated scale which is used to capture information on impairment (see the Recoded Mental Health Appendix for more information). Respondents who had indicated during the administration of any of the K6 items that they had experienced at least one of the K6 symptoms (defined in the note above variables KSSLR6MONED and KSSLR6YRED) at least ""a little of the time"" (i.e., KSSLR6MONED greater than 0 or KSSLR6YRED greater than 0) were asked about remembering to do things they needed to do (IMPREMEM), concentrating on doing something important when other things were going on around them (IMPCONCN), going out of the house and getting around on their own (IMPGOUT, IMPGOUTM), dealing with people they did not know well (IMPPEOP, IMPPEOPM), participating in social activities (IMPSOC, IMPSOCM), taking care of household responsibilities (IMPHHLD, IMPHHLDM), taking care of daily responsibilities at work or school (IMPRESP, IMPRESPM), and getting daily work done as quickly as needed (IMPWORK, IMPRESPM). Respondents who reported that they did not engage in an activity were asked a follow-up question to determine if they did not do so because of emotions, nerves, or mental health. For the WHODAS total score, WHODASSCED, a value of 3 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. A value of 2 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" difficulty performing, and a value of 1 was assigned for ""mild"" difficulty. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of 3 as having ""severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other non-missing responses for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASSCED which ranges from 0 to 24. WHODASSCED was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. For the alternative WHODAS total score, WHODASDAED, a value of 1 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" or ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of a 1 as having ""moderate or severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other non-missing responses for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASDAED which ranges from 0 to 8. WHODASDAED was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. Specific details about these variables are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix.

WHODASTOTSC,"NOTE: The following two variables, WHODASTOTSC and WHODASDASC, are score variables that indicate the level of impairment for respondents. These variables are based on imputation-revised data collected from a series of thirteen questions asking respondents how much difficulty they experienced in doing eight daily activities in the one month in the past year when they were at their worst emotionally (defined in the note above variables WHODASSCED and WHODASDAED). For the original WHODAS total score, WHODASTOTSC, a value of 3 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. A value of 2 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" difficulty performing, and a value of 1 was assigned for ""mild"" difficulty. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of 3 as having ""severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other responses (or imputed values) for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASTOTSC which ranges from 0 to 24. WHODASTOTSC was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. For the alternative WHODAS total score, WHODASDASC, a value of 1 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" or ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of a 1 as having ""moderate or severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other responses (or imputed values) for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASDASC which ranges from 0 to 8. WHODASDASC was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. The alternative version of the WHODAS total score (WHODASDASC) was used in the regression model to determine SMI. Specific details about these variables are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix.
