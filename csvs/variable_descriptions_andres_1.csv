CIGARREC,"NOTE: This variable incorporates values from the two questions shown below. This variable also incorporates values from two probe questions that were asked when the respondent answered DON'T KNOW or REFUSED to the second question shown below. Now think about the past 30 days, from [DATEFILL] up to and including today. During the past 30 days, have you smoked part or all of a cigar or cigarillo? How long has it been since you last smoked part or all of a cigar or cigarillo?"
COCYRBFR,"NOTE: The variables COCYRBFR and COCAGLST were not edited with respect to one another. Therefore, inconsistencies could exist between these two variables. Earlier questions were about the past 12 months. This question is about the year before that, that is, from [DATEFILL - 12 MONTHS] to [DATEFILL]. During that year, beginning [DATEFILL - 12 MONTHS] and ending [DATEFILL], did you use any form of cocaine, even once?"
CADRLAST,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: Beginning in 2017, respondents who reported that they used alcohol on 0 days in the past 30 days are no longer asked questions in the consumption of alcohol module that pertain to the past 30 days. This change has resulted in an increase in the number of respondents who were coded as ""blank"" compared with data from 2016 and prior years. However, this change was determined not to have affected the comparability of estimates since 2017 with those prior to 2017. Next we return to the topic of alcohol. Remember that by a ""drink"", we mean a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it. We are not asking about times when you only had a sip or two from a drink. Earlier, the computer recorded that you drank at least one alcoholic beverage within the past 30 days, that is, since [DATEFILL]. Please think about the last time you drank any alcoholic beverage. How many drinks did you have that time?"
CIGARTRY,How old were you the first time you smoked part or all of a cigar or cigarillo?

CIGARYFU,Did you first smoke part or all of a cigar or cigarillo in [CURRENT YEAR - 1] or [CURRENT YEAR]? Did you first smoke part or all of a cigar or cigarillo in [CURRENT YEAR - 2] or [CURRENT YEAR - 1]? In what month in [CURRENT YEAR] did you first smoke part or all of a cigar or cigarillo?
CODRGUSE,"How much, if at all, has the COVID-19 pandemic affected your drug use other than alcohol? By drugs we mean cannabis, which includes marijuana or any cannabis product, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, hallucinogens, such as LSD, and prescription medications including benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Ativan, stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall, and opioids such as hydrocodone or oxycodone."

COLDMEDS,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. The last questions were about prescription drugs.

Beginning in 2003, respondents aged 65 or older who reported that they were covered by Medicaid were asked to confirm their answer. Medicaid is a public assistance program that pays for medical care for people with low income and people with disabilities. The Medicaid program in [STATE FILL] is also called [MEDIFILL].

Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. Think about your use of cigarettes during the past 30 days as you answer these next questions.

Logically, these respondents would not have smoked a cigarette in the past 12 to 24 months. In addition, CIGYRBFR was not edited with respect to CIGAGLST or CIGDLLST.
