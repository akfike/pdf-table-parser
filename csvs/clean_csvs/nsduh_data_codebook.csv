MAIIN102,MAJORITY AMER INDIAN AREA INDICATOR FOR SEGMENT,,1,Segment in an American Indian area,"The Census provides data for five types of American Indian areas (AIAs): • Federally-recognized American Indian reservations (AIRs) and off-reservation trust land areas – areas that have been set aside by the U.S. for the use of American Indian tribes. The tribes have primary governmental authority over the AIRs and associated off-reservation trust lands. Federal AIRs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State-recognized American Indian Reservations (SAIRs) - reservations established by some State governments for tribes recognized by the State. The tribes may have governmental authority over the SAIRs. SAIRs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. • Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) - areas intended to represent the former American Indian reservations that existed in Indian and Oklahoma territories prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. OTSAs are contained within the State of Oklahoma but may cross all other area boundaries. • Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) - areas identified and delineated for federally-recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. A TDSA is intended to encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with the delineating federally-recognized American Indian tribe. TDSAs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs) - areas identified and delineated for State-recognized tribes that are not federally- recognized and do not have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. SDTSAs provide State-recognized tribes without reservations statistical data for a geographic area that encompasses a substantial concentration of tribal members. SDTSAs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. The AIAs are mutually exclusive, i.e., no AIA can overlap another AIA. In cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. Some NSDUH segments can cross more than one AIA. In order to assign a single AIA to a segment, a ‘majority’ AIA variable was created by summing the total number of dwelling units within each of the AIAs within the segment and then assigning the AIA with the most dwelling units to that segment. The resulting 'majority' AIAs were summarized to form MAIIN102. MAIIN102 is based on 2010 census data."

POVERTY3,RC-POVERTY LEVEL (% OF US CENSUS POVERTY THRESHOLD),"(IRFAMPMT, IRFAMSSI, IRFAMSVC, IRFSTAMP)",.,Persons Aged 18-22 in a College Dorm (See comment above),"The following variable, POVERTY3, indicates a person’s family income relative to poverty thresholds. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns a poverty threshold for each combination of family size and number of children in the household. To be at 100% of the poverty threshold is equivalent to having a family income that is the same as the poverty threshold. A poverty level less than 100% indicates having a family income less than the poverty threshold and therefore defined by the Federal government as living in poverty. A poverty level greater than 100% indicates having a family income greater than the poverty threshold. The previously created variable POVERTY2, was created using the recoded version of family income that had a top-coded level of $100,000 or more. Starting in 2015, the finer income questions were revised to expand the top level to include the responses $100,000 - $149,999 and $150,000 or more. The variable POVERTY3 account for these additional income levels through the use of the finer family income variable. Despite these changes, POVERTY3 is considered comparable with POVERTY2. POVERTY3 was created for each individual based on their poverty threshold (determined by their age, family size, the number of children in the household, and total family income). Since NSDUH only collects categorical values of family income, for each level of income, the midpoint of each range was assigned as the effective family income. The highest level of income, $150,000 or more, was assigned a value of $180,000. Prior to the questionnaire change in 2015 that expanded the top level of income categories, the highest level of income was $100,000 or more and the assigned family income was $120,000. Family income was divided by the poverty threshold and multiplied by 100 to show family income as a percentage of the federal poverty threshold. Respondents aged 18 to 22 currently living in a college dormitory (GQTYPE2='C') were set to system missing and do not have a valid value for this variable."

PNRMAINRSN,RC-MAIN REASON FOR MISUSING PAIN RELIEVERS LAST EPISODE,,.,Unknown (See comment above),"The following main reason for misusing pain relievers, PNRMAINRSN, is defined based on answers to questions about respondents’ reasons for misusing pain relievers for their last misuse. Respondents could report more than one reason for misusing pain relievers the last time. If they reported more than one reason, then they were asked to report the main reason. If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data. In the documentation below, values of 11-18 in PNRRSMAIN reflect situations where respondents reported more than one reason for their last misuse, their “other” reason for their last misuse was their main reason for their last misuse, but the other reason was the reason specified as one of the eight categories below. 1. Main reason is to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=1,11), reported only one reason which was to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSPAIN=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relieve physical pain (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSPAIN=3). 2. Main reason is to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=2,12), reported only one reason which was to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSRELX=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to relax or relieve tension (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSRELX=3). 3. Main reason is to experiment or see what it’s like (PNRRSMAIN=3,13), reported only one reason which was to experiment or see what it’s like (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEXPT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to experiment or see what it's like (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEXPT=3). 4. Main reason is to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=4,14), reported only one reason which was to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRHIGH=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to feel good or get high (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSHIGH=3). 5. Main reason is to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=5,15), reported only one reason which was to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSLEP=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help with sleep (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSSLEP=3). 6. Main reason is to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=6,16), reported only one reason which was to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEMOT=1), or reported some other reason as their only reason but specified that this other reason was to help with feelings or emotions (PNRRSMAIN=99 and PNRRSEMOT=3). 7.

If data existed for the main reason question, then that response was considered to be their main reason. If respondents reported only one reason for their last misuse, then that logically was the main reason (i.e., these respondents were not asked the question for their main reason). If respondents reported that some other reason was their main reason for their last misuse, then their response was logically assigned from the write in data.

This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1.

For the alternative WHODAS total score, WHODASDAED, a value of 1 was assigned for each of the daily activities that a respondent indicated having ""moderate"" or ""severe"" difficulty performing, or if the respondent indicated not performing the activity due to problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. For activities that had a follow-up question, a response of ""yes"" was assigned a value of a 1 as having ""moderate or severe difficulty."" A value of 0 was assigned for all other non-missing responses for each activity. These assigned values were summed to calculate a total score for WHODASDAED which ranges from 0 to 8. WHODASDAED was set equal to 0 for respondents with KSSLR6MAX=0. Specific details about these variables are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix.
