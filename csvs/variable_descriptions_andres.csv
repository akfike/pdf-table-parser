ATXMDEYR,"NOTE: The variables in this section are recoded variables that were created from one or more of the edited or imputed variables from the preceding sections. NOTE: Certain source variables that were used to create recoded variables have valid values that might not have been reported or assigned for the current survey year. However, these values have been included in the general specifications in the codebook on how the recoded variables were created. See additional details about this issue in the Organization of the Data File section of this codebook introduction. NOTE: The following 16 variables are among all adult respondents who were asked the respective questions and are not confined to those respondents who were ultimately classified as having a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in their lifetime or past year. To produce estimates among adults with MDE, the analysis will need to be restricted by either the lifetime MDE variable (IRAMDELT) or the past year MDE variable"

AGE3,"NOTE: After a respondent has entered his/her birthdate in the first part of the questionnaire, he/she has multiple opportunities to change his/her age in response to consistency checks throughout the questionnaire. It is therefore possible for the age recorded by the respondent at the beginning of the questionnaire to be different than the age at the end of the questionnaire. The final age variable is determined using these two constituent age variables, in addition to the age calculated from the raw birthdate and the final edited interview date, the age entered in the questionnaire roster (if it exists), and the pre-interview screener age."

BKDRUG,"In the past 12 months, were you arrested and booked for possession, manufacture, or sale of drugs?"
ADDPREV,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: All of the respondents aged 18 or older were asked the questions in the Adult Depression module in this current survey year.

AIIND102,"The Census provides data for five types of American Indian areas (AIAs): • Federally-recognized American Indian reservations (AIRs) and off-reservation trust land areas – areas that have been set aside by the U.S. for the use of American Indian tribes. The tribes have primary governmental authority over the AIRs and associated off-reservation trust lands. Federal AIRs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State-recognized American Indian Reservations (SAIRs) - reservations established by some State governments for tribes recognized by the State. The tribes may have governmental authority over the SAIRs. SAIRs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. • Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) - areas intended to represent the former American Indian reservations that existed in Indian and Oklahoma territories prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. OTSAs are contained within the State of Oklahoma but may cross all other area boundaries. • Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) - areas identified and delineated for federally-recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. A TDSA is intended to encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with the delineating federally-recognized American Indian tribe. TDSAs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs) - areas identified and delineated for State-recognized tribes that are not federally- recognized and do not have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. SDTSAs provide State-recognized tribes without reservations statistical data for a geographic area that encompasses a substantial concentration of tribal members. SDTSAs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. The AIAs are mutually exclusive, i.e., no AIA can overlap another AIA. In cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. The variable AIIND102 is based on 2010 census data and is defined by mapping the census block in which a respondent resides to the 2010 census file."

AKSSLR6WRST,"NOTE: The following variable, AKSSLR6WRST, is an alternative version of the original worst K6 total score in the past year (KSSLR6MAX) with values ranging from 0 to 17 rather than 0 to 24. This alternative total score was calculated by assigning a value of 0 when KSSLR6MAX had a value from 0 to 7 and assigning a value of 1 to 17 when KSSLR6MAX had a corresponding value from 8 to 24. This alternative version was used in the regression model to determine SMI because SMI prevalence was typically extremely low for respondents with worst K6 total scores less than 8. Specific details about this variable are provided in the Recoded Mental Health Appendix."

However, these respondents subsequently specified a valid response for an offense in the past 12 months. A code of 5 in BKOTH indicates that respondents reported being arrested/booked at least once in the past 12 months but did not indicate at least one offense for which they were arrested in that period. In the past 12 months, were you arrested and booked for some other offense besides these that have been named? Please do not include minor traffic violations."

We are not asking about times when you only had a sip or two from a drink. Have you ever, even once, had a drink of any type of alcoholic beverage? Please do not include times when you only had a sip or two from a drink."

ALCNUMDKPM,"The following variable, ALCNUMDKPM, was defined as the product of the number of days a user consumed alcohol in the past month (IRALCFM) and the average number of drinks consumed per day on the days alcohol was used in the past month (ALCUS30D). A value of missing was assigned whenever a respondent said that they had not used alcohol in the past month (IRALCFM=91, 93 or ALCUS30D=991, 993) or the average number of drinks consumed per day on the days alcohol was used in the past month was unknown (ALCUS30D=985, 994, 997, 998) or logically assigned to 5 or more (ALCUS30D=975)."

BLNTEVER,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: When respondents previously reported never using marijuana but reported lifetime use of cigars with marijuana in them (i.e., ""blunts""), a consistency check was triggered only when respondents reported using blunts in the past 30 days. Therefore, BLNTEVER was assigned a code of 11 when respondents reported using blunts but they did not report use in the past 30 days, and they previously had reported never using marijuana. Sometimes people take some tobacco out of a cigar and replace it with marijuana. This is sometimes called a ""blunt"". Have you ever smoked part or all of a cigar with marijuana in it?"

ADPSDAYS,"NOTE: Beginning with the 2008 survey, respondents who answered ""don't know"" or ""refused"" to questions corresponding to the variables ADPSHMGT, ADPSWORK, ADPSRELS, and ADPSSOC are no longer asked the question corresponding to ADPSDAYS unless they entered a response of 1 to 10 in at least one of the other questions corresponding to ADPSHMGT through ADPSSOC. About how many days out of 365 in the past 12 months were you totally unable to work or carry out your normal activities because of your You can use any number between 0 and 365 to answer"
ALCUS30D,"NOTE: Beginning in 2015, level 975 was updated to ""AT LEAST 4 or 5 Logically assigned"" to reflect the change in the threshold for binge alcohol use among female respondents from 5 or more drinks on an occasion prior to 2015 to 4 or more drinks on an occasion in 2015. See the note below for ALCBNG30D. On the ALC30DAY/ALCESTFL days that you drank during the past 30 days, how many drinks did you usually have? Count as a drink a can or bottle of beer; a wine cooler or a glass of wine, champagne, or sherry; a shot of liquor or a mixed drink or cocktail."
BLNTNOMJ,"NOTE: The variable BLNTNOMJ was assigned a code of 5 if respondents were not asked this question because they reported in the TOBACCO module that they smoked cigars in the past 30 days but reported in the BLUNTS module that they did not smoke cigars with marijuana in them in the past 30 days. It could be logically inferred that all of the cigars that these respondents smoked in the past 30 days did not have marijuana in them. BLNTNOMJ was assigned codes of 14 or 24 if respondents were not asked this question and they reported in the BLUNTS module that they smoked a cigar with marijuana in it in the past 30 days. A code of 14 was assigned if respondents reported in the TOBACCO module that they had smoked cigars but not in the past 30 days. A code of 24 was assigned if respondents reported in the TOBACCO module that they had never smoked part or all of a cigar. Earlier, you reported that you had smoked part or all of a cigar during the past 30 days. During the past 30 days, did you smoke any cigars that did not have marijuana in them?"
ADPSHMGT,"NOTE: Beginning with the 2008 survey, the questions corresponding to the variables ADPSHMGT, ADPSWORK, ADPSRELS, and ADPSSOC no longer allow respondents to choose the category 95 (ACTIVITY DOES NOT APPLY). Think about the time in the past 12 months when [NUMPROBS] with your mood [WASWERE] most severe. Using the 0 to 10 scale shown below, where 0 means no interference and 10 means very severe interference, select the number that describes how much [NUMPROBS] interfered with your ability to do each of the following activities during that period. You can use any number between 0 and 10 to answer. How much did your [FEELNOUN] interfere with your ability to do home management task, like cleaning, shopping, and working around the house, apartment, or yard?"
ALCYDAYS,
BLNTREC,"NOTE: When respondents previously reported using marijuana but reported less recent use of marijuana than they reported for blunts, a consistency check was triggered only when respondents reported using blunts in the past 30 days. Therefore, BLNTREC was assigned a code of 12 when respondents reported last using marijuana more than 12 months ago but reported using blunts more than 30 days ago but within the past 12 months. How long has it been since you last smoked part or all of a cigar with marijuana in it?"

ADPSWORK,"During that time in the past 12 months when your [FEELNOUN] was most severe, how much did this interfere with your ability to work? You can use any number between 0 and 10 to answer."
ALCYR,
BMI2,"BMI2 was created from the variables WTPOUND2 and HTINCHE2 according to the formula of 703 times WTPOUND2 divided by the square of HTINCHE2. BMI2 was set to a SAS missing value (unknown) if WTPOUND2 had a value of 9985, 9994, 9997, or 9998 or if HTINCHE2 had a value of 985, 994, 997, or 998."
ADPSYCH,
ALCYRBFR,"NOTE: The variables ALCYRBFR and ALCAGLST were not edited with respect to one another. Therefore, inconsistencies could exist between these two variables. Earlier questions were about the past 12 months.

BOOKED,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. The next questions are about encounters with the police or the court system. Not counting minor traffic violations, have you ever been arrested and booked for breaking the law? Being ""booked"" means that you were taken into custody and processed by the police or by someone connected with the courts, even if you were then released."

Adults with a past year MDE (AMDEYR=1) and a ""severe"" or ""very severe"" maximum level of interference are assigned AMDEIMP=1. Adults without a past year MDE (AMDEYR=2) or a maximum level of interference of ""none"", ""mild"", or ""moderate"" (and no missing data across the four role domains) are assigned AMDEIMP=2. All other respondents are assigned a missing value for AMDEIMP. Beginning in 2021, missing values for AMDEIMP were replaced using statistical imputation. The imputation-revised variable used in analysis, IRAMDEIMP, appears in the Imputed Adult Depression section."

The imputation-revised variables used in analysis, IRAMDELT and IRAMDEYR, appear in the Imputed Adult Depression section. A respondent was classified as having a major depressive episode (MDE) in their lifetime, AMDELT=1, if they reported experiencing at least five out of the nine criteria used to define an adult as having had MDE in their lifetime, where at least one of the criteria is a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities (ADSMMDEA=1). An adult was classified as NOT having a major depressive episode (MDE) in their lifetime, AMDELT=2, if they met either of these conditions: 1. Reported experiencing fewer than five out of the nine criteria used to define an adult as having had MDE in their lifetime 2. If the number of criteria used to define an adult as having had MDE in their lifetime is unknown (ADSMMDEA=94,97,98) and the respondent reported at least one of the following: 1. Never having had a period of time lasting several days or longer when felt sad, empty, or depressed (ADDPREV=2), discouraged about how things were going in life (ADDSCEV=2), and lost interest in most things usually enjoyable 2. Experienced the feelings in (i), but they did not last most of the day, nearly every day for two weeks or longer (ADLSI2WK=2) or (ADDPR2WK=2). 3. Experienced the feelings in (i) most of the day, nearly every day for two weeks or longer, but the feelings lasted less than an hour when mood was most severe and frequent (ADWRHRS=1). 4. Experienced the feelings in (i) most of the day, nearly every day for two weeks or longer for at least an hour during those times when mood was most severe and frequent, but emotional distress was mild (ADWRDST=1), there was never a time when emotional distress was so severe that you could not be cheered up (ADWRCHR=4), and there was never a time when your emotional distress was so severe that you could not carry out your daily activities (ADWRIMP=4). 5. Experienced the feelings in (i) most of the day, nearly every day for two weeks or longer for at least an hour and the severe distress were more than mild or at some point could not be cheered up or could not carry out daily activities, but never had any other problems during those weeks, such as changes in sleep, appetite, energy, the ability to concentrate and remember, or feelings of low self-worth (ADDPPROB=2).

ANYNDLREC,"The values in this section may be inconsistent with values for variables in other sections of the interview. Items in this section were edited when respondents legitimately skipped out of these items based on prior answers in earlier sections. Otherwise, variables in one section of the interview generally were not edited to make them consistent with variables in another section of the interview. This note applies to variables in this section marked by a1. NOTE: The variables in this section are recoded variables that were created from one or more of the variables from three of the preceding sections: Recoded Drug Use, Special Drugs, and Imputed Special Drugs. NOTE: Certain source variables that were used to create recoded variables have valid values that might not have been reported or assigned for the current survey year.
