IRHERRC,
IRPMNICDEP,"NOTE: The following variable, IRPMNICDEP, is the imputation-revised version of the nicotine dependence variable (PMNICDEP) derived from the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) and the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Based on the NDSS and the FTND, a respondent who smoked cigarettes in the past month was defined as having nicotine dependence if they met either the NDSS or the FTND criteria for dependence. Specific details are provide in the Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Disorder appendix."
IRTRQNMREC,
IRHERYFU,
IRPNRANYREC,"NOTE: The following 18 variables refer to any use of prescription drugs. Any Use of prescription drugs is defined as either the use of one's own prescription medication as directed by a doctor or the misuse of prescription drugs. Misuse of prescription drugs is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own medication; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Due to potential underreporting of lifetime prescription drug use, users are cautioned against using the levels ‘More than 12 months ago’ and ‘NEVER USED XXX’ in analysis for the following variables: IRPNRANYREC, IRTRQANYREC, IRSTMANYREC, and IRSEDANYREC."
IRTRQNMYFU,"NOTE: The following four variables pertain to the age and date of first misuse of tranquilizers. Respondents who were past year initiates (IRTRQNMINIT=1), that is respondents who misused tranquilizers for the first time in the 12 months prior to the date of the interview, are included in the domain. Respondents who are not past year initiates (IRTRQNMINIT ne 1) receive an appropriate skip code."

IRIMPHHLD,
IRPYSEV5ALC,"The next set of variables are imputation-revised measures of substance use disorder severity for alcohol and drugs and are based on the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. The severity of an SUD according to DSM-5 criteria is determined by the number of individual criteria recorded as positive for a particular substance. Respondents were classified as having an SUD of mild severity if they met two or three SUD criteria for that substance, an SUD of moderate severity if they met four or five SUD criteria for that substance, and a severe SUD if they met six or more SUD criteria for that substance. The construction of all SUD variables is described in more detail in the Nicotine Dependence and Substance Use Disorder appendix. NOTE: Respondents who reported past year alcohol use but indicated use of alcohol on 5 or fewer days in the past year were not asked the questions on alcohol use disorder. However, respondents who reported past year alcohol use and had a missing value for the number of days they used alcohol in the past year were asked the questions on alcohol use disorder. Therefore, it is possible for a respondent to have used alcohol on 5 or fewer days in the past year according to IRALCFY but to be classified as having a past year substance use disorder of alcohol."

MAIIN102,"The Census provides data for five types of American Indian areas (AIAs): • Federally-recognized American Indian reservations (AIRs) and off-reservation trust land areas – areas that have been set aside by the U.S. for the use of American Indian tribes. The tribes have primary governmental authority over the AIRs and associated off-reservation trust lands. Federal AIRs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State-recognized American Indian Reservations (SAIRs) - reservations established by some State governments for tribes recognized by the State. The tribes may have governmental authority over the SAIRs. SAIRs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. • Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) - areas intended to represent the former American Indian reservations that existed in Indian and Oklahoma territories prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. OTSAs are contained within the State of Oklahoma but may cross all other area boundaries. • Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) - areas identified and delineated for federally-recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. A TDSA is intended to encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with the delineating federally-recognized American Indian tribe. TDSAs may cross State and all other area boundaries. • State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs) - areas identified and delineated for State-recognized tribes that are not federally- recognized and do not have an AIR or off-reservation trust land. SDTSAs provide State-recognized tribes without reservations statistical data for a geographic area that encompasses a substantial concentration of tribal members. SDTSAs must be defined within a single State but may cross county and other types of boundaries. The AIAs are mutually exclusive, i.e., no AIA can overlap another AIA. In cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. Some NSDUH segments can cross more than one AIA. In order to assign a single AIA to a segment, a ‘majority’ AIA variable was created by summing the total number of dwelling units within each of the AIAs within the segment and then assigning the AIA with the most dwelling units to that segment. The resulting 'majority' AIAs were summarized to form MAIIN102. MAIIN102 is based on 2010 census data."
